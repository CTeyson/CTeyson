# Hello! Hallo! こんにちは！
**Hi there, I'm Chris 👋**

📍 Mobile Project Consultant based in Berlin.

💼 Currently leading mobile projects at SAP. Previously, I was an iOS developer working on apps like [REWE](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/rewe-supermarkt/id714121079), [Penny](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/penny-coupons-angebote/id1096204041), and [SAP Ariba Shopping](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sap-ariba-procurement/id1451570638).

🗣 Before diving into iOS development, I worked in voice AI, creating apps for Google Assistant and Alexa. [Check out my work here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUjKNkITuyE) (German only).

🌐 Passionate about Augmented Reality. I wrote my master's thesis on the future impact of AR, focusing on Apple's ARKit.

🎌 When I'm not coding, you'll find me:
- 🔣 Learning Japanese
- 🌍 Traveling the world
- 🎧 Listening to music
