# Hey there!

My name is Chris and I develop native iOS apps in cologne.   

💬  
Before I started my role as an iOS developer I have created various voice apps for Google Assistant and Alexa.    
An impression you can see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUjKNkITuyE) (_German only_).  

👀  
Another passion of mine is anything related to Augmented Reality. This is why I wrote my master thesis about the future impact of AR and Apples ARKit. 

🏳️‍🌈  
When I develop and engineer software my goal is to make software as welcoming as possible. Software should be as inclusive as possible. 
A tool everybody can use and feels welcome by doing this. 


Here some things I like to do, when I'm not coding: 
* 🎌 learning Japanese 
* 🚄 travel around the world
* 🎧 listening to a lot of music
