# Hey there!

My name is Chris and I develop native iOS apps in cologne.   
Before I started my role as an iOS Dev I have created various voice apps for Google Assistant and Alexa.    
More information you can find on this [overview page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUjKNkITuyE) (_German only_).  
Also I wrote  my master thesis about Augmented Reality. You can hit me up if you want to chat about the future of this amazing technology.  

Here some things I like to do, when I'm not coding: 
* ðŸŽŒ learning Japanese 
* ðŸš„ travel around the world
* ðŸŽ§ listening to a lot of music
