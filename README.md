# Hello! Hallo! こんにちは！

My name is Chris and I develop native iOS apps in Cologne.   

💬  
Before I started my role as an iOS developer I have created various voice apps for Google Assistant and Alexa.    
An impression of my work you can see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUjKNkITuyE) (_German only_).  

👀  
Another passion of mine is Augmented Reality. I even wrote my master thesis about the future impact of AR. Therefore I used Apples ARKit to research about the usage of AR.

🏳️‍🌈  
When I develop and engineer software my goal is to make software as welcoming as possible. Software should be as inclusive as possible. 
A tool everybody can use and feels welcomed. 


Here some things I like to do, when I'm not coding: 
* 🎌 learning Japanese 
* 🚄 traveling around the world
* 🎧 listening to a lot of music
