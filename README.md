# Hey there!

My name is Chris and I develop iOS apps in Cologne.   
Before I started my role as an iOS Dev I have created various voice apps for Google Assistant and Alexa.    
More information you can find on this [overview page](https://www.rewe.de/rezepte-ernaehrung/voice-assistant) (_German only_).  
Also I focused in my master thesis on Augmented Reality and you can hit me up if you want to chat about the future of this amazing technology.  

Here some things I like to do, when I'm not coding: 
* 🎌 learning Japanese 
* 🚄 travel around the world
* 🏊‍♂️ swim around
